# Counting DNA Nucleotides

The task is to calculate the number of nucleotides 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' encountered in the DNA string of length at most 1000 nt. Code must return four integers (separated by spaces) counting the respective number of times that the symbols 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' occur in the DNA string.

# Transcribing DNA into RNA

The task is to transcribe DNA string having length at most 1000 nt to RNA string by replacing all occurrences of 'T' with 'U'.
