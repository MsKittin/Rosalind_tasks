# Counting DNA Nucleotides

The task is to calculate the number of nucleotides 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' encountered in the DNA string of length at most 1000 nt. Code must return four integers (separated by spaces) counting the respective number of times that the symbols 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' occur in the DNA string.

# Transcribing DNA into RNA

The task is to transcribe DNA string having length at most 1000 nt to RNA string by replacing all occurrences of 'T' with 'U'. Code must return the transcribed RNA string.

# Complementing a Strand of DNA

The task is to write reversed complementary nucleotide sequence of given a DNA string of length at most 1000 bp. Code must return the reversed complement of given DNA string.

# Computing GC Content

Given: At most 10 DNA strings in FASTA format (of length at most 1 kbp each).
Return: The ID of the string having the highest GC-content, followed by the GC-content of that string.
